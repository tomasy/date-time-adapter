## Configuration
Configure the position latitude and longitude where you live and horizon. Normally the sunset/sunrise
is set to some values whe the sun is below horizon.

## Example
Turn the lamp in bedroom only on weekdays
`if the time of day is 06:13 and DateTime is not weekend, turn BedroomLamp on

To start the fan evey hour and switch it of after 5 minutes  
`if DateTime minutesS is 20, turn Fan on`  
`if DateTime minutesS is 25, turn Fan off`

To start the fan evey second hour when it is dark and switch it of after 5 minutes  
`if DateTime is dark and DateTime minutesS is 20 and DateTime is even_hour, turn Fan on`  
`if DateTime minutesS is 25, turn Fan off`

If it only for 5 minutes
`while DateTime minutes5 is 5, turn Fan on`

A motion sensor is onlyactive between 10:00--10:59 
`if DateTime Hour_N is greater than 9 and DateTime Hour_N is less than 11 and Motion sensor is motion, turn Light on`

## Bugs
### Bug 1.
Because of a bug in gateways rule enginge it will not handle rules with more than one properties correctly.
If a rule is `if DateTime minute is 5 and DateTime is dark, turn Fan on` it will not work directly if the
rule is created when it is dark. To work it must first be not dark.  
To solve this after the rule is created go to the things page and click on the dark property in DateTime device.
The same is valie for e.g. 'weekend'.
